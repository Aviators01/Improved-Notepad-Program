Visibility:
-Core function of that being a text editor is clearly apparent by the white blank canvas and the
"ribbon" of tools below.

Constraints:
-At this point, one constraint is an inability to right click the canvas. However, there are cut/copy/
paste tools on the ribbon as well as the edit menu that help the user to be able to achieve those
functionality.

Feedback:
-Buttons provide visual feedback.
-clicking open and save also provide feedback by way of opening a new window where user can choose
file to open or location to save canvas contents.

Mapping:


Consistent:
-Buttons are proportional to each other.
-Any opened window has the same icon and title.

Affordance:
-Blank canvas and blinking cursor suggests typing area.
-Also, keyboard shortcuts for cut,copy, and paste also work here.
-Button icons suggest their functionality
-Trackpad scrolling works here

Simplicity:
-Program is simplistic in a light-weight program with few options.

Minimize memory load:
-Buttons provided instead of user having to memorize keyboard shortcuts for cut/copy/paste

Diagnose/recover from errors:
-No errors yet known as it is just a simple text editor.

Control and freedom:
-There are two ways to exit the program: the red "X" in the upper right corner and a quit option in
the File menu.

Flexibility:
-Program allows user to save a file in any format that they wish.

Types of help:
-Reference under the help menu provides help inexperienced users.
-Limitations/Troubleshooting under the help menu informs user what actions the program is unable to perform.
-About menu items informs user of license, programmer, and program description.
